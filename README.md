## Upcoming Features
<p>
  The <b>Anchaal App</b> is not just limited to Women, even it will work for men who fall prey to many such problems in fire today.
We will soon link the App to official portal of <b>Anchaal Web</b> where the <b>live status, SOS help calls and User Data</b> can be fetched on one go. The App will re-direct to the website in-hand of security officials.
</p>
<p>
  Also, the App will have <b>Direct Connectivity Feature</b> through a <b>Server Module</b> which will enable all those users having installed with this app can get notified for the help and can voluntarily reachout the needy.
Now this will be easily accessed with the backend data by the server and it will redirect the SOS call location to the users nearby.
Infact, the Victim can also pin that spot as unsafe and further actions can be taken by the police or security officials.
